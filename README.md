# Blog post express server

## ALL CRUD endpoints work.
Create Post, Get Post, get Posts, delete Post, update Post 
which all update the Posts collection that stores post model. 

Extra Credit: storing tags as an array, can see code in front-end github https://github.com/larissachen13/hw4. Used functions Array.join and .split to store the tags as arrays on frontend that way I did not have to do that much modifying on backend.
